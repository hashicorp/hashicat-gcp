HashiCat: A Terraform built application for use in HashiCorp workshops

# via CLI

Includes "Meow World" website.

You can try this code out in Google Cloud Shell! Click below to clone the repo into your Cloud Shell environment. You will also need a project with the Compute Engine APIs enabled in order to execute the terraform code.

[![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.svg)](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/hashicorp/hashicat-gcp.git&cloudshell_tutorial=walkthrough.md)

Once you have the code opened, rename your `terraform.tfvars.example` file to `terraform.tfvars`. Change the **prefix** and **project** variables in the file. You will need a project with the Compute Engine APIs enabled in order to execute the terraform code. For example, your terraform.tfvars file might look like this:

```
prefix = "yourname"
project = "google-project-id"
```

Once you have saved your `terraform.tfvars` file run the following commands in your Cloud Shell:

```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Wait a few minutes and watch your Meow World application deploy! ðŸ˜»
